# Solana Journey
<details>
<summary>This section documents my journey in learning and interacting with the Solana Blockchain</summary>  

## Learning The Basics
I started exploring Solana by learning how to interact with its blockchain using TypeScript and web3.js. My initial projects, stored in the [solana-learn repository](https://github.com/NkamaWilliams/solana-learn), include:

### Token Creation:
- Scripts for creating new SPL tokens.
- Setting metadata and initial supply for tokens.
### Fund Transfer:
- Simple programs for transferring SOL and SPL tokens between accounts.
### Creating and Executing Transactions
...and more

## Intermediate Projects
To deepen my understanding of the smart contract creation process, I built small projects using anchor including:
- [A Vault](https://github.com/NkamaWilliams/vault-solana)
- [An Escrow](https://github.com/NkamaWilliams/escrow-solana)
- ... and more

## Turbin 3 Builders Cohort
I also participated in the Turbin 3 Builders Cohort where I further developed my knowledge. The work I did there can be found in [this repo](https://github.com/NkamaWilliams/solana-startr)

# Projects
<details>
  <summary>This section contains some of the Projects I have worked on during my journey</summary>

## **The Menagerie**  
An all-in-one launchpad designed to connect, educate, and support developers building on Solana. I personally worked on:  
- **SolQuest:**  
  - A decentralized bounty platform where users can post and complete bounties for USDC rewards.
- **Desearch:**  
  - A decentralized platform for researchers to publish papers and receive micropayments.  

## **Solucky**  
A Solana-based lottery DApp designed for fun and interaction:  
- Users can wager a set amount of devnet sol and are asked to guess the correct one of three numbers
- Guessing the correct number rewards them with the same amount wagered
- Failure results in losing the wager

## TODO: Build an application leveraging the SVM API
